# classification
A simple cats and dogs classifier 

The model is currently over-fitting
The problem could be from the use of 2000 images for
training and 804 images for validation. I'm look forward to
improve upon the performance of the model as the days go by.

It is currently achieving 90% of training accuracy and 50% of
validation accuracy.
